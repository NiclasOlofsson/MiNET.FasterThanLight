# MiNET Faster Than Light (FTL)

MiNET FTL is an example implementation of a proxy server intended to be used in order to transfer players between a set of MiNET running in *node* mode. The FTL server keep sessions with MCPE clients using a proxy, and forwards traffic to various MiNET nodes dealing with the regular MiNET game logic.

Even though MiNET FTL use TCP to communicate between proxy and node, any means of communication can be used.

MiNET FTL is a proof of concept implementation, mostly used for testing the actual API provided by MiNET itself. It should **NOT be used for production** of any kind. Code is provided AS IS and no support will be provided. If someone is hurt as a result of misuse of this code, it is entirely on you. No bits or bytes where hurt in the production of this software.

**It might not even work ...**

## WARNING
**It is most likely NOT working since it is not yet updated to latest version of MiNET**
